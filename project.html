            <h1>Projects in CART</h1>
            <h2>Budget Calculator</h2>
            <p>In the CART, I developed a budget calculator tool that assists visitors in managing their finances. The
                tool includes California taxes, allowing visitors to input their annual income. It calculates their
                monthly income and subtracts California taxes if they reside there. Additionally, it allows users to
                subtract expenses, revealing how much money they have remaining.

                <h2>Abelisaurus Wiki</h2>
                <p>During our English class, we immersed ourselves in the captivating world of the ‘Jurassic Park’ book,
                    where dinosaurs miraculously came back to life. Inspired by these prehistoric creatures, our class
                    collectively decided to create a comprehensive dinosaur Wikipedia-style website. For my
                    contribution, I chose to focus on the fascinating Abelisaurus dinosaur. My website meticulously
                    chronicles the history and daily life of Abelisaurus, shedding light on its habits, discoveries, and
                    the remarkable environment it inhabited.</p>

                <h2>Certificayion Forms</h2>
                <p>In our web application class, we design certification forms by applying the knowledge and skills
                    acquired during our coursework. The primary objective behind creating these certification forms for
                    visitors is multifaceted: to deliver focused and relevant educational content, empower individuals
                    with enhanced employability prospects, and provide flexible learning opportunities tailored to their
                    needs.

                <h2>Chess Game</h2>
                <p>In our Web Application class, we immersed ourselves in the intricacies of JavaScript. To hone our
                    skills, each student collaborated with a partner to create a text adventure or game. My partner and
                    I opted to develop a chess game, a timeless classic enjoyed by millions worldwide. Leveraging
                    JavaScript, we meticulously crafted functionality for each chess piece. To create a unique chess
                    experience, we empowered players to customize the board size. The dimensions ranged from 6x6 up to
                    12x12, ensuring better visibility for players. As the board size increased, so did the piece count.
                    Additionally, we allowed players to choose their preferred board size, while the original dimensions
                    remained the standard 8x8.</p>

                <h2>Jurassic Park bakery</h2>
                <p>In our English class, we delved into the thrilling world of the ‘Jurassic Park’ book, where dinosaurs
                    miraculously return to life. Inspired by this prehistoric adventure, we embarked on a web
                    development project related to ‘Jurassic Park.’ My personal choice was to create an enticing bakery
                    website within the confines of this ancient ecosystem. Visitors exploring ‘Jurassic Park’ can now
                    conveniently place online orders for delectable treats or visit our brick-and-mortar bakery
                    locations scattered throughout this captivating realm.</p>
