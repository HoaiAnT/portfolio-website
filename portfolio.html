                    <h3>Jurassic Park</h3>
                    <p>In Michael Crichton's Jurassic Park (1990), the entrepreneur, John Hammond, has a passion to bring
                        dinosaurs back to real life. For this purpose, he created a zoo park using the genetics of some animals
                        that were similar to dinosaurs. This allowed them to recreate dinosaurs and create them into different
                        species. Mathematician, Lan Malcolm, warns John Hammond about the failure of park by chaos theory that
                        people cannot control and predict nature. After reading this book, the reader will have some valuable

                    <h3>Ready Player One</h3>
                    <p>The OASIS, a virtual world where individuals can explore, learn, and be whoever they want to be, offers a sense
                        of freedom and control that the real world lacks. However, it also poses risks to personal information and
                        mental health. The programmers should not develop an OASIS like virtual World. Wade’s inactive lifestyle,
                        emotional overeating, and depression underscore the wider health hazards linked to deep immersion, interpersonal
                        connections resulting from virtual world addiction, and the lack of security for student information within the

                    <p>Social media is a real challenge for today's teenagers. Everything has positives and negatives but social media
                        affects how teenagagers mind grow and social media will affect how their minds grow because of the negative
                        contents of social media. In this generation, they can find anything on the internet, it will arouse their
                        curiosity. Social media will be the biggest challenge for teenagers to grow their mindset. Social media has a
                        negative influence in the lives of teenagers because it is distracting and especially is mental health and
                        emotional problems (sources 1,3 and 4). There are a lot of bad...</p>

                    <h3> Calvin Coolidge and Theodore Roosevelt</h3>
                    <p>
                        Calvin Coolidge and Theodore Roosevelt were two US government presidents who have different views of the role
                        of the Federal Government. As the world becomes more advanced, social problems increase, requiring policies
                        to be established, so there are many disagreements. According to President Coolidge's speech, he argued that
                        freedom organizers were people who fought to free themselves from the shackles of government policy.
                        Coolidge supported the growing effort to raise society's moral standards, but he cautioned people about the

                <p>Besides programming tasks, we engage in non-programming work such as designing web pages or games,
                    conducting research, and outlining the project’s content before diving into actual coding. While
                    programming, I encountered a JavaScript issue, and there was a minor conflict with my partners as we
                    brainstormed ideas. To overcome the JavaScript problem, I applied logical thinking and broke down the
                    issue into smaller steps. Additionally, I resolved the conflict by maintaining clear and respectful
                    communication, always keeping the end users in mind.</p>

                <p>During our time at the Center for Advanced Research and Technology (CART), students utilized these
                    desktop computers for programming and design projects. Initially, we delved into HTML, the code used to
                    structure web pages and their content. Subsequently, we expanded our knowledge by exploring CSS styling,
                    which is based on the structure provided by HTML. Finally, we delved deeper into JavaScript—a scripting
                    language that enables the creation and control of dynamic website content.</p>
