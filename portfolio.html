            <h3>Jurassic Park</h3>
            <p>In Michael Crichton's Jurassic Park (1990), the entrepreneur, John Hammond, has a passion to bring
                dinosaurs back to real life. For this purpose, he created a zoo park using the genetics of some animals
                that were similar to dinosaurs. This allowed them to recreate dinosaurs and create them into different
                species. Mathematician, Lan Malcolm, warns John Hammond about the failure of park by chaos theory that
                people cannot control and predict nature. After reading this book, the reader will have some valuable
                lessons from ...</p>

            <h3>Ready Player One</h3>
            <p>The OASIS, a virtual world where individuals can explore, learn, and be whoever they want to be, offers a
                sense of freedom and control that the real world lacks. However, it also poses risks to personal
                information and mental health. The programmers should not develop an OASIS like virtual World. Wade’s
                inactive lifestyle, emotional overeating, and depression underscore the wider health hazards linked to
                deep immersion, interpersonal connections resulting ...</p>

            <h3> Calvin Coolidge and Theodore Roosevelt</h3>
            <p>
                Calvin Coolidge and Theodore Roosevelt were two US government presidents who have different views of the
                role of the Federal Government. As the world becomes more advanced, social problems increase, requiring
                policies to be established, so there are many disagreements. According to President Coolidge's speech,
                he argued that freedom organizers were ...

            <p>During our time at the Center for Advanced Research and Technology (CART), students utilized these
                desktop computers for programming and design projects. Initially, we delved into HTML, the code used to
                structure web pages and their content. Subsequently, we expanded our knowledge by exploring CSS styling,
                which is based on the structure provided by HTML. Finally, we delved deeper into JavaScript—a scripting
                language that enables the creation and control of dynamic website content.</p>

        <section class="program">
            <p>Besides programming tasks, we engage in non-programming work such as designing web pages or games,
                conducting research, and outlining the project’s content before diving into actual coding. While
                programming, I encountered a JavaScript issue, and there was a minor conflict with my partners as we
                brainstormed ideas. To overcome the JavaScript problem, I applied logical thinking and broke down the
                issue into smaller steps. Additionally, I resolved the conflict by maintaining clear and respectful
                communication, always keeping the end users in mind.</p>
