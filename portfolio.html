            <p>In Michael Crichton's Jurassic Park (1990), the entrepreneur, John Hammond, has a passion to bring
                dinosaurs back to real life. For this purpose, he created a zoo park using the genetics of some animals
                that were similar to dinosaurs. This allowed them to recreate dinosaurs and create them into different
                species. Mathematician, Lan Malcolm, warns John Hammond about the failure of park by chaos theory that
                people cannot control and predict nature. After reading this book, the reader will have some valuable

            <h3>Ready Player One</h3>
            <p>The OASIS, a virtual world where individuals can explore, learn, and be whoever they want to be, offers a
                sense of freedom and control that the real world lacks. However, it also poses risks to personal
                information and mental health. The programmers should not develop an OASIS like virtual World. Wadeâ€™s
                inactive lifestyle, emotional overeating, and depression underscore the wider health hazards linked to
                deep immersion, interpersonal connections resulting ...</p>

            <h3> Calvin Coolidge and Theodore Roosevelt</h3>
            <p>
                Calvin Coolidge and Theodore Roosevelt were two US government presidents who have different views of the
                role of the Federal Government. As the world becomes more advanced, social problems increase, requiring
