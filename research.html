                <h2>Research and Planning</h2>
                <p>Before embarking on the programming journey, thorough research and planning are crucial. Start by
                    understanding student's target audience. Who are they? What are their needs and pain points? Next, conduct a
                    competitor analysis. Explore similar websites or tools to learn from their strengths and weaknesses.
                    Finally, devise a content strategy. Plan the type of content you’ll include (text, images, videos) and
                    ensure it aligns with student's overall goals.

                    <h2>Wireframing</h2>
                    <p>Wireframing serves as the blueprint for student's website or tool. It’s like creating a skeletal structure
                        before adding flesh and skin. A wireframe is a visual representation of student's layout, devoid of
                        colors or fonts. Why wireframe? It helps you plan the information hierarchy, user interactions, and
                        overall layout. Tools like InVision or Balsamiq can assist in creating wireframes, but even pen and
                        paper work well.</p>

                    <h2>User Flow Mapping:</h2>
                    <p>Imagine student's website as a journey. User flow mapping defines how users will navigate through it.
                        Consider the steps they’ll take from entry to conversion. Map out the paths they’ll follow,
                        including interactions with buttons, forms, and other elements. This step ensures a seamless user
                        experience.

                    <h2>Sketching and Drafting</h2>
                    <p>Think of this step as sketching out student's wireframes. Focus on layout and functionality rather than
                        intricate design details. Position elements such as navigation menus, buttons, and content blocks.
                        Write down what you mention on the website.</p>

                    <h2>Adding Details and Testing </h2>
                    <p>Once you have basic wireframes, add more detail. Include labels, headings, and placeholders for
                        content. This step bridges the gap between wireframes and the final design. Additionally, user
                        testing is essential. Gather potential users and test the usability of student's wireframes. Identify any
                        pain points or areas for improvement.</p>

                    <h2>Prototyping</h2>
                    <p>Turn student's wireframes into interactive prototypes. Tools like Figma or Adobe XD allow you to create
                        clickable mockups. Prototypes help visualize user interactions. Test these prototypes with real
                        users to validate student's design decisions.</p>
