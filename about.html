                <h1>about.</h1>
                <p>I was born in Vietnam, a country known for its rich and diverse cuisine. When I was 11 years old, I
                    embarked
                    on a new chapter in the United States. Now, living in Clovis, California with my family, I'm excited to
                    explore new opportunities, especially in school.</p>

                <h2>New Journey</h2>
                <p>After I started my new journey in a new country at my high school, I took a few years to develop my
                    English
                    skills. Day by day, I get on well with my education, I start to get honor rolls by my efforts.</p>

                <h2>My Future Plan</h2>
                <p>My biggest passion lies in the realm of technological entrepreneurship. Within the walls of my school, I
                    immerse myself in the trifecta of math, history, and computer science classes. The intricate puzzles of
                    mathematics captivate me, and I relish the challenge of solving logic problems. As I delved into the
                    annals
                    of history, one figure stood out—the indomitable Napoleon Bonaparte. His military campaigns and
                    transformative political reforms reverberated across French history, leaving an indelible mark.  And in
                    the
                    hallowed halls of Computer Science class, I gain not just technical knowledge, but also a mindset—an
                    understanding of how technology weaves its magic. By combining these things, I realized I was interested
                    in
                    becoming a technology entrepreneur.</p>

                <h3>Chess</h3>
                <p>Chess, my favorite game, transcends mere entertainment—it unfolds as a cerebral duel between two distinct
                    minds. Within its sixty-four squares, your brain will face obstacles from opponents. Decisions are made
                    both intuitively and analytically, and memory is put to the ultimate test. In this complex battle of
                    wits, every action reflects the clash of minds, leaving an indelible mark on the picture of strategic
                    warfare.</p>

                <p>Badminton, a delightful blend of strategic finesse and physical agility, serves as both a cathartic
                    outlet for my emotions and an entertainment activity after a taxing day. Engaging in this sport not only
                    allows me to exercise but also replenishes my energy, empowering me to tackle other tasks.</p>

                <p>During my leisure hours, I find comfort in listening to K-pop music. The catchy melodies and rhythmic
                    beats attract me. Whether it’s the soulful ballads or the energetic dance tracks, K-pop offers a diverse
                    range of sounds that resonate with me. I often immerse myself in the music. It’s a delightful way to
                    unwind and recharge, allowing me to momentarily step away from life’s demands.</p>

                <p>In my hometown, I actively participate in environmental protection initiatives. Whether it’s planting trees
                to enhance green spaces or picking up litter in local parks, I believe small actions collectively make a
                significant impact. Additionally, I encourage recycling within the community. By being mindful of my

                <p>I have an insatiable curiosity that draws me toward uncharted territories, lands that remain untrodden by my
                footsteps. Each new destination becomes a canvas upon which I paint my memories, weaving together
                experiences that color my existence. Exploration, for me, it’s a journey of the senses. I relish the
                opportunity to immerse myself in unfamiliar cultures, to taste exotic cuisines that tantalize my palate.
                Yet, beyond the bustling streets and crowded squares, there lies another facet of exploration, one that
                resonates with my soul. It’s the quest for green havens, those sanctuaries where nature thrives undisturbed.
                I love exploration, it brings me joy to my life.</p>
