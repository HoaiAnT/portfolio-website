            <p>This website documents my enrichment journey at the Center for Advanced Research and Technology (CART).
                Through my experiences there, I gained valuable insights into fields like technology. In addition to
                studying, I also share what my daily life looks like, sharing the habits and challenges that fuel my
                passion.</p>

            <p>My intrigue with the intricate patterns and logical structures of mathematics weaves seamlessly with my
                inquisitiveness about the narratives and powerful influences that have shaped our world, transforming
                history into a voyage across time. Additionally, I harbor a curiosity about how technology has evolved
                and reshaped the world around us.</p>
