    <h1 id="top">Calvin Coolidge and Theodore Roosevelt</h1>
    <section class="first">
        <p>Calvin Coolidge and Theodore Roosevelt were two US government presidents who have different views of the role
            of the Federal Government. As the world becomes more advanced, social problems increase, requiring policies
            to be established, so there are many disagreements. According to President Coolidge's speech, he argued that
            freedom organizers were people who fought to free themselves from the shackles of government policy.
            Coolidge supported the growing effort to raise society's moral standards, but he cautioned people about the
            need to understand the impact of the branches of government. In addition, he promoted the rights of
            individuals and understood the difficulties of citizens. He emphasized the importance of the Declaration of
            Independence as the inspiration for free government throughout the world. When the government actively
            listens to its citizens' concerns and translates them into effective laws that tackle real problems, it can
            spark a wave of hope and satisfaction. These laws are not just about individual happiness, but also give
            collective insight from government decisions. Coolodge also emphasized the importance of low taxes. He
            believed that it would lead to prosperity and subjugation for the Americans when everyone has enough funds
            to serve their own concentration. As a citizen, the government has a responsibility to ensure that every
            citizen is treated equally and raise their own voice. The benefits of individual rights bring greater
            opportunities for the personal, such as improving the standard of their lives.

    <section class="second">
        <p>In contrast, President Roosevelt believed that the government should have more power and be more active to
            oppose private interests, and promote the interests of the many over the special interests of the few. He
            was concerned about powerful businesses going beyond government control. He wanted to tighten government
            control over citizens to protect mutual benefit instead of reducing the government's impact on the people of
            Coolidge. For this purpose, Roosevelt represented the people using the influence he could bring as
            president. He used that status as a weapon to reduce the rights of private businesses. As a result, the
            government has the right to free access to the books of any corporations to prevent corporate misconduct. To
            understand the people, they put a high value on the states' rights. Through the states, they know whether
            those policies are suitable for them or not. Even so, Roosevelt was worried that people who do not
            understand politics will give opinions that will cause damage to the whole country. He emphasized the
            importance of escaping from the control of money in politics as he was concerned about the imbalance in the
            rights of people. For all that, he focuses attention on self-government, and the need to combine practice
            common sense. In other words, he acts for the common good of the people and community.

    <section class="last">
        <p>As a citizen, I hold up the protection and expansion of people's rights. Even though both presidents
            protected the rights of people, they have different political philosophies. On the other hand, I concur with
            Roosevelt's point of view about how he promoted the collective over the individual. In spite of this,
            President Coolidge's responsive and relevant policies will help to reduce the impact of the government on
            people and make them more comfortable with their decisions in life. In fact, this will increase inequality
            or disparities between different regions or groups by following natural laws. Meanwhile, self government
            allows decisions to be made by those who understand the specific needs and challenges of our communities.
            This can lead to more accessible and pertinent policies that are more suitable for peoples' needs, and also
            avoid being influenced by private forces. However, it will be difficult for people to raise their voice if
            the government does not have good intentions and the decisions they make are not suitable to save their own
            rights. Overall, both have their strengths and weaknesses, which is great to combine President Coolidge's
            understanding of citizen worries and the strict control of private businesses, the promotion of collegiality
            of Theodore Roosevelt's policies, and adjust their policies to suit each different situation.
