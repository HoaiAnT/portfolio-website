    <h1 id="top">Drawbacks of Building an OASIS Public School System in the Real-World</h1>
    <p> The OASIS, a virtual world where individuals can explore, learn, and be whoever they want to be, offers a sense
        of freedom and control that the real world lacks. However, it also poses risks to personal information and
        mental health. The programmers should not develop an OASIS like virtual World. Wade’s inactive lifestyle,
        emotional overeating, and depression underscore the wider health hazards linked to deep immersion, interpersonal
        connections resulting from virtual world addiction, and the lack of security for student information within the
        virtual realm.
    </p>
    <p> Immersing oneself excessively in a virtual world may inadvertently result in neglecting crucial real-life
        responsibilities, weakening personal connections, overlooking health risks, and disregarding environmental
        concerns. Engaging excessively in virtual worlds, such as the OASIS, can have substantial real-world
        repercussions in terms of health and relationships. From a health perspective, it may result in physical and
        mental ailments, including stress-related injuries, vision issues, and psychological disorders. On the
        relational front, it can contribute to social isolation and the erosion of communication skills, ultimately
        weakening personal connections. According to Ready Player One, “But I spent the vast majority of my time sitting
        in my haptic chair, getting almost no exercise at all. I also had a habit of overeating when I was depressed or
        frustrated, which was most of the time” (Cline 196). Wade’s story stands as a poignant testament to the perils
        of excessive immersion in virtual worlds. His candid acknowledgment of a sedentary lifestyle and emotional
        eating, fueled by feelings of depression and frustration, mirrors broader health risks. This narrative evidence
        reinforces the notion that intense virtual engagement can lead to neglect of physical health and mental
        well-being. Additionally, it sheds light on relational consequences, as Wade’s preoccupation with the virtual
        realm likely hampers his productivity and interpersonal connections.
    </p>
    <p> The OASIS school system was built to help the players escape the real world’s lacks. The captivating nature of
        the OASIS virtual world game, with its ability to provide intense psychological rewards and experiences, raises
        concerns about potential addictive behaviors among users. When a virtual world becomes as immersive and enticing
        as the OASIS, individuals may prioritize their digital lives over their real-world existence. This shift could
        have serious implications for mental health, leading to isolation, depression, and a sense of unfulfillment in
        reality. When users utilize the virtual world as an escape from their everyday lives, they may find it
        increasingly difficult to disengage and face the challenges of the real world. According to Ready Player One,
        “Being human totally sucks most of the time. Video Games are the only thing that make life bearable” (Cline 11).
        It illustrates how the OASIS, with its intense psychological rewards, can become a preferred real world, leading
        users to prioritize it over their actual lives. This preference can have profound mental health implications, as
        it may cause users to lose touch with reality, resulting in isolation, depression, and a lack of fulfillment
        outside the virtual realm. The text demonstrates that the OASIS’s immersive nature can foster an addiction that
        makes facing the real world increasingly challenging for the players.
    </p>
    <p> Public schools within the OASIS function similarly to traditional schools, but in a virtual setting. As a
        result, they require student data for admission purposes. Despite assurances from school administrators about
        safeguarding confidential student details like names and addresses, the integrity of this information can still
        be compromised. Despite a principal’s commitment to keeping students’ personal information confidential such as
        their names and addresses, money can still sway many individuals. In the story, IOI, a major corporation,
        managed to influence the principal of Wade’s school. Offered an undisclosed but presumably substantial sum, the
        principal divulged confidential details, compromising safety. This highlights that even in an environment where
        students strive for anonymity, the public school system remains unconditionally trustworthy. According to Ready
        Player One, “...we decided to contact a few OPS administrators and offer them a bribe. Do you know how little a
        school administrator makes a year, Wade? It's scandalous" (Cline 143). The dialogue emphasizes that, despite the
        virtual environment, OASIS public schools still demand student data akin to traditional schools. However, the
        integrity of this data remains uncertain, as the narrative reveals how school administrators can be influenced
        by bribery due to their meager salaries. This scenario underscores the potential risks associated with
        collecting and safeguarding confidential information within virtual platforms, where even well-intentioned
        promises of privacy may falter under economic pressures.
    </p>
    <p> The OASIS offers an enticing escape from the limitations of the real world, it comes with significant risks.
        Wade’s struggles in “Ready Player One” serve as a stark reminder of the potential dangers of excessive virtual
        immersion. As developers consider creating similar virtual environments, they must balance the allure of
        infinite possibilities with the need to safeguard users’ mental health and personal well-being. The OASIS’s
        immersive nature can foster addiction, leading individuals to prioritize it over their actual lives. Players
        must be aware of the real and virtual world, it will help players balance life and be responsible for real life.
