    <h1 id="top">Negative effects from social media</h1>
    <p> Social media is a real challenge for today's teenagers. Everything has positives and negatives but social media
        affects how teenagagers mind grow and social media will affect how their minds grow because of the negative
        contents of social media. In this generation, they can find anything on the internet, it will arouse their
        curiosity. Social media will be the biggest challenge for teenagers to grow their mindset. Social media has a
        negative influence in the lives of teenagers because it is distracting and especially is mental health and
        emotional problems (sources 1,3 and 4). There are a lot of bad things on social media. If parents let their
        children decide for themselves with their phones, it will affect their minds and feelings by the contents they
        watch on social media
    </p>
    <p>Social media is a negative effect for teenagers because it leads to mental health and emotional issues. When they
        spend too much time on social media, it will lead them into addiction. Addiction causes an overload of dopamine
        and makes teens want to spend all their time on that. These things can make them too lazy to exercise or play
        sports. And what they see online will affect how they feel. “It has been linked to increased anxiety, depression
        and decreased relationship skills. One study found social media can be more addictive than cigarettes and
        alcohol for some people” (source 1 “Andrea McDaniels”). They will spend less time with their family and when
        they reject communication with people it can cause them to become depressed. They can't express how they feel or
        what they want to say. This will cause inevitable loneliness. It reduces the affection of the family together.
        Besides, when they are inactive, it will lead to bone, eye and brain problems. Addiction on social media will
        make them always being on their phone and don’t want to leave, it causes lack of sleep, and then you won't have
        energy for the next day. Day by day, it became their habit. They take time to discover what their age should be.
        When they are older, they don’t have much time with their families, the times they are on their phone will be a
        waste of time.
    </p>
    <p>One of the biggest downsides of social media is that it is a distraction. Students become confused and this ruins
        their work ethic surrounding assignments.Many students have said that they lose focus when doing assignments,
        and don’t pay attention when someone is talking because of the temptation of the phone. “Some 57 percent of
        teens said social media often distracts them when they should be doing homework, and 54 percent also are
        distracted when they should be paying attention to people they’re with” (source 3 “Frank Catalano”). People
        around them will get frustrated with their friends for being on the phone when they're together. They wish their
        parents spent less time on their devices. Once you're interrupted while doing a task, the odds increase that
        you'll forget an important step in the process you were in the middle of before you were distracted. Chances are
        you may even forget to return to the original task or not know what changes occurred while you were distracted.
        It makes you unable to concentrate on something. The presence of distractions captures attention and impairs
        behavioral performance task.
    </p>
    <p>However, some people argue that social media has a positive effect for teenagers because they feel less
        loneliness and depression. They can use emojis or comment on other people's posts on social platforms to express
        their feelings, and they can indirectly communicate with their friends via social media. “16 percent said using
        social media makes them feel less depressed and 25 percent said they feel less lonely, compared to 3 percent who
        said social media use made them feel more depressed or lonely” (Source 3”Frank Catalano” ). This isn’t true,
        however, while social media is a great way to keep in touch with friends and family, it also is not the same as
        face-to-face communication. Being able to see each other's nonverbal communication cues helps us understand what
        the other person is saying more easily. “What's more, many teens spend so much time online checking statuses and
        likes that they forget to interact with the people right in front of them. For this reason, friendships and
        dating relationships can suffer when social media takes center stage in a person's life. As a result, teens risk
        having relationships that are not deep or authentic” (source 4 “Sherri Gordon”). Your online identity is not the
        same as your real-world identity because the characteristics you represent online differ from the
        characteristics you represent in the physical world. The things you express indirectly are easy to misunderstand
        and it will lead to bad relationships. When talking to someone in person, you get the feedback you need right
        away. You can be talking, clear up misunderstandings and have a better feel for intent by reading body language.
        You can even have engaging discussions, something that is hard to do online.
    </p>
    <p>With all this in mind, it’s easy to see how social media affects the teenagers from improper use of social
        networks by making their teenagers addictive, and affect their health. For young people, they need a good time
        to communicate and learn from each other to grow their minds.What they see online also affects the brain
        development of teenagers. While some people argue that social media has more positive effects than negative,
        health is alway the most important. Everything is good and bad but to overcome phone addiction, they should
        teach their children about using your phone sensibly.
